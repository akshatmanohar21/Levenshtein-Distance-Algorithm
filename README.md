# Edit Distance Matrices

This project calculates the **Levenshtein Distance** between different words. The Levenshtein Distance is a way to measure how different two words are by counting the number of changes (**insertions, deletions, or replacements**) needed to make the words the same.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
- The program takes **two words** as input.
- It uses **Dynamic Programming** to calculate the minimum number of operations needed.
- The result is displayed as the **edit distance** between the two words.


### List of Examples:

- Levenshtein & Lavenstaein: 

Edit distance = 3

- TryHackMe & TriHackingMe

Edit Distance: 4

- Optimization & Progressive

Edit Distance: 11

- This is easy & This is easy

No Edit distance since the words are same: 0
